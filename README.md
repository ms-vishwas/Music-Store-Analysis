# SQL Project: Music Store Data Analysis
This project involves performing a comprehensive data analysis on a music store dataset using SQL. The goal is to extract various insights related to sales, customers, employees, and music genres.

### Project Objectives
The project is structured into three sets of questions, ranging from easy to advanced, covering different aspects of the music store's operations:

### Question Set 1 - Easy
This set focuses on fundamental queries to understand basic facts about the music store data:

1. Identify the senior-most employee based on job title.

2. Determine which countries have the most invoices.

3. Find the top 3 values of total invoices.

4. Identify the city with the best customers (highest sum of invoice totals) for a promotional music festival.

5. Determine the "best customer" by finding the person who has spent the most money.

### Question Set 2 - Moderate
This set delves into more specific analytical queries, particularly focusing on music genres and artists:

1. Retrieve the email, first name, last name, and genre of all Rock Music listeners, ordered alphabetically by email.

2. Identify the top 10 artists who have written the most rock music, returning their name and total track count.

3. Find all track names with a song length longer than the average song length, returning the name and milliseconds, ordered by longest songs first.

### Question Set 3 - Advanced
This set involves complex queries requiring joins and aggregations to uncover deeper insights:

1. Calculate the total amount spent by each customer on different artists, returning customer name, artist name, and total spent.

2. Determine the most popular music genre for each country (genre with the highest amount of purchases). For countries with shared maximum purchases, return all relevant genres.

3. Identify the customer who has spent the most on music for each country, returning the country, the top customer, and the amount spent. For countries with shared top spending, provide all such customers.

### Technologies Used
SQL: For querying and analyzing the music store database.

### Expected Outcome
By completing this project, you will gain hands-on experience with various SQL query types, including aggregation, joining multiple tables, subqueries, and analytical functions, to derive meaningful business insights from a relational database.
